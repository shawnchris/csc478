      <P class="style9">Final projects can be done individually or in groups of 
		up to three students. Each group or individual must submit a project 
		proposal for approval by the submission deadline below. Additional 
		information and resources relevant to project will be posted on this 
		page.</P>

		TYPES</font></H3>
      <P class="style9">The final project for the class may involve one or a 
		combination of the following.</P>
<ul>
	<li>
	<P class="style9"><span class="style10"><strong>Data Analysis: </strong>
	</span>The application of the knowledge discovery process to one or more 
	real-world data sets (see <a href="resource.html">Online Resources</a> for 
	pointers to various data sets). The tasks must include preprocessing and 
	preparation of the data, data explorations (using statistical approaches to 
	provide an overview of data characteristics), data visualization, and the 
	application of two or more machine learning techniques on the data (e.g., 
	classification, estimation, clustering, association rule discovery, etc.). 
	At least one of the machine learning techniques used must involve building 
	and evaluating a predictive model. Unless otherwise approved (as part of the 
	project proposal), the project must involve the use of Python scripts to 
	perform various data analysis or mining tasks (including available modules 
	or libraries such as NumPy, Scipy, Mathplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn, and 
	others. In addition to Python tools, you may also use other third-party 
	tools (preferably open-source) to assist with tasks such as preprocessing, 
	data storage and management, and visualization. The deliverables for the 
	project must include a detailed data analysis report, including relevant 
	findings an conclusions about the data, as well as documented code used as 
	part of the project.</P>
	</li>
	<li>
	<P class="style9"><span class="style10"><strong>Application Development:
	</strong></span>The development and evaluation of an original application 
	using machine learning and data mining techniques. The goal of this type of 
	project is not to perform a full analysis of a given data set, but rather to 
	perform useful tasks in a given application domain. The application must be 
	tested and evaluated using a specific data set. The application must also 
	involve&nbsp; the use of one or more of the modeling techniques relevant to 
	the course topics. Your application may also include a significant extension 
	of an existing application discussed in class materials or other sources (in 
	this case, the application must be extended to include additional or more 
	sophisticated types of modeling and analysis). The deliverable for the 
	project must include the fully documented code, distribution files, 
	including any third party sources, installation/deployment documents 
	(including examples, screen shots of test runs, etc.), data used for the 
	application, and a project report providing a description of the components 
	of the application and the results of any evaluation. Many different types 
	of applications are possible, but some examples of such applications include 
	(but are not limited to):</P>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<P class="style9"><strong>Recommender Systems:</strong> applications 
		that learn from user profiles to provide personalized recommendations 
		for items in a given domain such as movies, books, products, documents, 
		stocks, twitter feeds, etc.</P>
		</li>
		<li>
		<P class="style9"><strong>Social Computing Applications:</strong> 
		applications that analyze social network data, including social 
		connections, social annotations (such as tags), microblog feeds (e.g., 
		on Twitter, Facebook, etc.), blog posts or customer review, and other 
		sources in order to aggregate and present users with useful information 
		or predictions.</P>
		</li>
		<li>
		<P class="style9"><strong>Business Analytics:</strong> applications 
		involving the use of machine learning and statistical analysis in order 
		to derive business intelligence and assist in business decision making, 
		including tasks such as customer segmentation, predicting customer 
		behavior, market analysis, price prediction, inventory management, Web 
		site analytics, etc.</P>
		</li>
		<li>
		<P class="style9"><strong>Document Filtering and Analysis:</strong> 
		applications involving the use of machine learning and text mining 
		techniques to indentify or filter relevant documents, analyze the 
		content of documents to discover interesting patterns (such as 
		identifying topics or&nbsp; events in news stories, analyzing features 
		of items based on customer reviews, spam filtering, etc.), recommending 
		news items, tweets, etc., based on predictive&nbsp; models of users, 
		etc.</P>
